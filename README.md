### These are my dotfiles

These dotfiles are inspired by my friend [outragedline](https://github.com/outragedline), whose motivated me to build my own environment.

Feel free to explore and use any part of my config if it fits your style. Just keep in mind that Iâ€™m constantly tweaking and updating things, so expect occasional changes and force pushes.

#### Installation

On Arch Linux, make sure you have `yay` and `chezmoi` installed, then run the following command:

```sh
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/HD-29139/dotfiles.git
```
