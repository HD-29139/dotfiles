# These are my dotfiles

This repo is meant to store my enviroment, you can use it if you want, but there are many times where i commit things,
then i regret wathever i commited and just make another commit that revert the changes or even edit and force push,
i also update this repo almost every day

If you like my configs, i recommend you to pick what you want and add to your own dotfiles

## How to install?

On archlinux, simply have yay installed and run the following

```
git clone https://github.com/outragedline/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
sh .install.sh
```

If you dont want everything, you can just pick the configs you want and run the commands in the script manually to install the dependencies.
