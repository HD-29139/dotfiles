# These are my dotfiles

## How to install?

On archlinux, simply have yay installed and run the following

```
git clone https://github.com/outragedline/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
sh .install.sh
```

If you dont want everything, you can just pick the configs you want and run the commands in the script manually to install the dependencies.
