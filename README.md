### These are my dotfiles

These dotfiles are inspired by my friend [outragedline](https://github.com/outragedline), whose motivated me to build my own environment.

Feel free to explore and use any part of my setup if you like it. i'll be trying to update it constantly too.

#### Installation

On Arch Linux, make sure you have `yay` and `chezmoi` installed, then run the following command:

```sh
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/HD-29139/dotfiles.git
```
