# These are my dotfiles

This repo is meant to store my enviroment, you can use it if you want, but there are many times where i commit things,
then i regret wathever i commited and just make another commit that revert the changes or even edit and force push,
i also update this repo almost every day

If you like my configs, i recommend you to pick what you want and add to your own dotfiles

## How to install?

On archlinux, simply have yay and chezmoi installed and run the following

```sh
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/outragedline/dotfiles.git
```
